# puzzling-gift

A puzzle solver

## Setup

This project uses firebase to host the static files as well as firebase to store the puzzle data.

Once you create a new firebase project and pull down `firebase-tools` from NPM, run

```
firebase login
firebase init
```

These will authenticate with firebase as well as set up your project. Once you have the files building, you can run a `firebase deploy` to start the application up.
